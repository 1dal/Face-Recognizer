# Face-Recognizer :sunglasses:

A Face Recogniser which works in real time!
You get 3 options:

## 1) Add a new face to the dataset of known people :heavy_exclamation_mark:.
  
 Enter the name of the person and press ENTER when ready.
  
  
 A demo of this is shown below :wink::

 ### Photos of the person are clicked and then saved in a folder with the person's name as the folder name.
